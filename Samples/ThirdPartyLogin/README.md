Sample explanation:

- The code in this sample is used only to show the bookmarks functionality after login in with a 3rd-party provider.
- For reference how the 3rd-party provider functionality works check the following files:

## Samples\ThirdPartyLogin\thirdPartyLogin.html -> holds the html form of the login

## Samples\ThirdPartyLogin\js\sample.js -> from this file the ThirdPartyLoginManager is enabled & called

## Samples\lib\js\thirdPartyLoginManager.js -> this file holds the entire logic of 3rd-party login

## Localhost setup

-> If you use localhost the OKTA Sign-in redirect URIs should be:
http://localhost/idp/signin-oidc  
https://localhost/idp/signin-oidc  
https://localhost:8082/IDP/signin-oidc
"Make sure that the address where you are opening the sample from is added as valid Redirect URI address in your login provider.
For instance https://MobileServerAddress:8082/IDP/signin-oidc "

-> The settings in Milestone XProtext Management Server should be: - In the section RedirectURIs for web client you should add as valid RedirectUI the address where you are loading the samlpe from https://localhost:8082/XPMobileSDK/Samples/ThirdPartyLogin/thirdPartyLogin.html - In Milestone XProtect Mangement Client you should add as valid WebClient Return URI the address where you are loading the sample from. - For instance https://MobileServerAddress:8082/XPMobileSDK/Samples/ThirdPartyLogin/thirdPartyLogin.html

Then open your sample https://MobileServerAddress:8082/XPMobileSDK/Samples/ThirdPartyLogin/thirdPartyLogin.html and explore!
